# MetDEC

After a successful exploitation, one of the most significant steps in attacking a system is post-exploitation. If post-exploitation activities are confined with the better cycle of observe-orient-decide-act, further attacks will be more difficult. We built a python script, MetDEC, based on the ideas of spotting metasploit payloads and applying a concept of military deception to detect, mislead, and neutralize metasploit post-exploitation activities.
